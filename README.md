# Standup.py
Very simple python script that reminds me to stand up at work.

##Purpose
I have a standing desk at work but also have a tall chair so I can sit like I would with a normal sitting desk. I've found that I sit a lot more than I stand. I want to get in the habit of standing and moving more while at my desk so I've written this script to help me out with that.

##Instructions
Running this script with no arguments will use the defaults. 30 minutes of standing and 30 minutes of sitting with random exercises before you sit. You can also change the sit stand times by providing standing and sitting times in minutes. The 3rd argument should be either 1 or 0 and will determine if a random exercise is chosen for you before the prompt to sit.    

##Python version note
I have written this script using Python 3.5.1rc1 but have attempted to make this script backwards compatible with earlier versions of Python. However, I am not testing on earlier versions so there may still be issues. If you encounter any let me know.

##Workouts
Here are some of the exercises.

##Ideas
I'm thinking I'd like to modify this script so that it would be easy to run using another script. I would just need to add a parameter to control the number of iterations which is simple enough but before making the change I would like to think about it some more.
